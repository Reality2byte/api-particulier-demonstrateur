# `jest.config`

Jest configuration is in the jest.config.js file. You can modify as needed to customize Jest-s options for your tests.

To run the tests coverage, use the following command at the root of the project:

```bash
pnpm run test:coverage
```

This will run all test files in the **tests** directory using the Jest configuration defined in jest.config.js.
